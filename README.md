I addressed real-world challenges and acquired new skills, such as becoming familiar with different types of forestry, natural resources, and wildlife datasets. I gained knowledge about data collection procedures involving ESRI products, including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online Web Map Apps for various analyses, and other data collection and navigation apps such as Field Maps and Survey123. I also became familiar with the Trimble TerraFlex app, which is used for compliance-related inspections concerning the Public Lands Act.

In my work on the Aggregate Program, I managed geospatial data for aggregate pits and quarries across Ontario, particularly in the Aylmer-Guelph District with about 800 active sites. I georeferenced site plans using ArcGIS Pro, aligning them with LIO basemaps to ensure accuracy. I also developed extraction layers by interpreting site plan measurements and setbacks, using georeferenced plans for guidance on complex sites.

Updating the RIAU (Regional Information Analysis Unit) Story Map, I enhanced its functionality and user experience by adding interactive dashboards and web map applications, improving data accessibility and usability. I enriched descriptions to provide clear, comprehensive information for users.

For the ROD (Regional Operations Division) SharePoint site, I improved functionality and visual representation, optimizing navigation, load times, and overall performance. I revamped the design elements to create a more modern, engaging interface and implemented adjustments to enhance accessibility and usability.

In the Forms Modernization initiative, I helped make ministry forms accessible and compliant with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) standards. I developed AODA-compliant prototypes, updated identifying data, and collaborated with the DDISB forms team to ensure adherence to accessibility standards, contributing to meeting the Ontario Digital Accessibility Standard by September 1, 2024.
